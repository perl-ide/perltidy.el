#+TITLE: perltidy.el

* Perl::Tidy for Emacs

This is a version of [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/perltidy.el][perltidy.el]] that has been modified so that it can find the
closest =.perltidyrc= to use (thanks [[https://github.com/zakame][Zakame]]), and the ability to format on-save for
=perl-mode= and =cperl-mode=.

** Getting Started

#+NAME:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require 'perltidy) ; You have to put perltidy.el on your load-path
  (setq perltidy-on-save t)
#+END_SRC
