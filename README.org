#+TITLE: perltidy.el

* Perl::Tidy for Emacs - Zakame's version

This is a version of [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/perltidy.el][perltidy.el]] that I modified so that it can find the
closest =.perltidyrc= to use, even on non-remote buffers.  Originally this
change was on [[https://github.com/zakame/emacs-pde/commit/f5fc74][my Emacs-PDE]].
